Takeaways

1. The importance of time management is an even bigger deal than I probably first thought. It's something that I know I struggle with so I'll have to be really vigilant and strict in my routine.
2. I really enjoyed customizing my terminal with a little wizard dude and I'm looking forward to more ways to personalize and express myself as we go forward!

Strategies
1. Keep my calendar updated and check in every week to see how real life impacted or resembled the calendar I'd made to represent it.
2. Commit to breaking exercises, trying new things, and thinking ahead. Every bit of practice is still practice, and I learn best when my hands are moving.
